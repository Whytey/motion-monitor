A Python program that is used to monitor and manage the 'motion' software 
package (http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome).

motion-monitor receives notifications from motion about events that are 
occurring and then performs relevant actions on those events.

Currently supported actions:
 - Logging to a file.
 - Providing the status to the Zabbix monitoring service.
 
Functionality to come:
 - Add a timer to perform cleanup functions.
 - Provide a util script for performing cleanup functions.
 - Support 'metrics' of events that have occured.
 - Provide a JSON interface for retrieving motion-monitor data.
